very well said… When it all comes down, those who will stand are those who simply have a solid understanding of the basics… Because Algorithms would come and go, but a good, solid foundation in ML knowledge would transcend any major findings in time.
If its without any exception you shouldn't qualify it with 'almost'.
Can't agree more with Nishu and the commenters, at the end of the day, its about having a good team with a good grasp on tools available and how to formulate the problem.

However, Nishu and the responders have demonstrated the key feature for successful implementation of ML/AI: collaborative, positive, communications that develop individuals, groups and teams. I am always pleasantly surprised at the well-written responses from every one on this platform. Give me a focused team that can effectively communicate and we can solve any problem.
An algo only works well in one scenario, even if it is really a good one. That's why you find creating a new algo kind of meaningless but also, why the creation keeps going cuz some critical problems are still waiting for new methods to solve.
I agree! Reminds me of another famous quote, by Albert Einstein: "If I had an hour to solve a problem and my life depended on the solution, I would spend the first 55 minutes determining the proper question to ask, for once I know the proper question, I could solve the problem in less than five minutes."
The money is in matching and adapting algorithms to business problems.

The research is great and interesting but it's a long road from there to the coal face of business.
It's a strawman argument. No one claimed there is a best algorithm for all problems because the no-free lunch theorem is well known in the community.
