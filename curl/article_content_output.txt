   "content" : "About Me :) - Nishu Jain\n\nWho am I and what do I do â¦\n\nNishu Jain\n\nHey there!\n\nIâm Nishu Jain: A geek, cursed with little creativity.\n\nProfessionally, Iâm a Software Engineer who likes to play with data, algorithms, and especially, Artificial Intelligence/Deep Learning.\n\nI speak mostly Python but, have polyglottic tendencies. I believe in developing real-world products for people like you and me.\n\nAnd apart from being a full-fledged Tech-Geek, Iâve got a few real hobbies â¦ like -\n\n~ Reading & Writing\n\nAs you can see, Iâm writing on Medium â¦ da?\n\nSometimes, I do freelancing as well. So if youâve something interesting for me, ping me on Fiverr. Iâll be happy to talk to you.\n\nOn Medium: I like to write about Technology, Business, Psychology, Philosophy, etcâ¦ And from time to time, I tell short stories too and talk about art and stuff.\n\nSpeaking of which, I also do â¦\n\n~ Sketching\n\nYeah! I love the world of Art and I make it too - Wanna see my artwork?\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sketchscrolls\n\nLiked my work? ð®\n\nConnect with me on Instagram. (username: sketchscrolls)\n\n~ Playing Piano\n\nItâs kind of a new thing for me and I recently picked it up.\n\nIâve uploaded a few pieces on my personal Instagram account (username: one_anachronism).\n\nCurrently, Iâm trying my hands with western classical music and few anime openings (donât call me Otaku yet). Iâll soon upload some serious performance as well â¦. so till then, stay connected! ^_^\n\nTopics that interest me -\n\nTechnology, Programming, Designing, Investing, Business, Economics, Art, Psychology, Mathematics, Physics, Music, Mythology, Linguistics, Philosophy, Etymology, etcâ¦\n\nAll in all â¦\n\nIâm kind of a jack of all trades but, master of some - And Iâm proud of it.\n\nInstead of spending my life doing some sort of specialization, I would rather learn different domains, and try to fuse them together.\n\nI would rather add more dimensions to my personality, acquire more skills in my arsenal, and mix a little flavor in my life - than be living in a monochromatic world.\n\nAnd donât confuse my polymathic trait with a lack of dedication. Because, when Iâm in my \"research mode\", youâll have a pretty hard time surpassing me. I consume information like a sponge, process it like a machine, and try to see the bigger picture like a sage.\n\nThatâs who I am. (Hope I piqued your interest)\n\nEnough about me! Letâs get in touch\n\nGive ME a chance to know you. Shoot me an emailâ\n\nnishujain1997.19@gmail.com\n\nOr directly message me on Twitter â¦ Or LinkedIn or whatever\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/supersanskar\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/one_anachronism\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/sketchscrolls\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/weeping-angel\n\nFiverr: https://fiverr.com/nishu_jain\n\nHopefully, we can do something awesome together!\n\nHave a nice day.\n\nPS: I go by the name Sanskar Jain as well. Nishu is just my pen name!\n\nIf you enjoy reading stories, then Iâm sure you would love to be a Medium paying member. Itâs only $5 per month, and youâll get unlimited access to thousands and thousands of stories and writers.
